This is a simple Java Swing app to manage a csv of songs that I want to transcribe some day. Initially, this list was a sticky note on my computer, but I began to realize it was getting a bit long, so I made an app to manage it. 

--To Do--
Implement an intelligent search solution
Add options to sort the list differently
Add an optional description, category, or genre column (as complexity goes up, it may be worth implementing a database instead of using a CSV)
